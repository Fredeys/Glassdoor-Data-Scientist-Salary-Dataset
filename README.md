# Glassdoor Data Scientist Job Data

## Description
Welcome to the project! This repository contains a dataset of raw job listings scraped from Glassdoor, focusing primarily on Data Scientist positions. You'll find various attributes such as job title, salary estimate, company information, and moreâ€”all sourced directly from the web. Please note that this data is in its original, unprocessed form, as obtained through web scraping.

For those interested in the web scraping process, a web scraper was used to extract the data from Glassdoor. You can find detailed instructions on how to use the web scraper in the tutorial by Omer Sakarya, published on the "townrdsdatascience" blog.
